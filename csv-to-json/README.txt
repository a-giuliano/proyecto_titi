Instructions on how to convert a .xlsx file of tree data to CSV and then JSON format:

1) Download the .xlsx file from Google Sheets as a CSV file (with utf-8 encoding).

2) Move the file to the directory with the files formatCSV.sh and CSVtoJSON.py (or subdirectory).

3) Enter the following commands:

    ./formatCSV.sh path/to/CSVFile/nameOfTreesCSVFile.csv

    ./CSVtoJSON.py path/to/CSVFile/nameOfTreesCSVFile.csv path/to/newJSONFile/desiredNameOfTreesJSONFile.json

Now you should have a JSON file with all of the tree data from the original .xlsx file.

NOTE1: Minor manual editing of the CSV file may need to be done before the python script can handle it correctly
       if some data on the .xlsx file does not match up exactly to the what the script is expecting. For example,
       I had to change '160+' to '160' for the height of a tree because the script cannot handle the original input
       as a float, as it tries to do. 

NOTE2: The python script assumes the deathLevel attribute of each tree to be "Nivel 0: Afectaci√≥n 0 %". This
       assumption is made because the .xlsx file does not provide information about this field, but the field 
       is necessary for the database. This may be something to change if it leads to inaccurate data.
